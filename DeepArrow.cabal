Name:			DeepArrow
Version:		0.4.0
Synopsis:		Arrows for "deep application"
Category:               Combinators, Control
Cabal-Version:          >= 1.6
Description:
  This library provides a framework for type-directed composition of value
  editors (non-syntactic transformations).  The tools enable \"deep function
  application\" in two senses: deep application of functions and
  application of deep functions.  These tools generalize beyond values and
  functions, via the @DeepArrow@ subclass of the @Arrow@ type class.

  The primary module is "Control.Arrow.DeepArrow".  Examples in
  "Control.Arrow.DeepArrow.Examples".
  .
  /Note/: Many of the type signatures use infix type operators (as in
  @a~>b@).  In reading the documentation and code, be aware that infix
  operators bind more tightly than @->@.
