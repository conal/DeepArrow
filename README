The DeepArrow library provides a framework for type-directed composition
of value editors.  For a fuller description and link to documentation,
please see the Haskell wiki page:

  http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/DeepArrow

You can configure, build, and install all in the usual way with Cabal
commands.

  runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
  runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  runhaskell Setup.lhs install

See src/Control/Arrow/DeepArrow/Examples.hs for examples.
